//Porblem Statement Topic : Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted 
// i made a new array and had two pointers which is start and end and now we are checing the sum of start and end and if it is
// equal to target value than we are taking the index of ans(array ) and if it is not than we are doing start++ / end--;
